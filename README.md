# sound-data

This repo shows an example on how to create music from data. 
This repo has three main files:

1. The .py script that is from Mltechniques. Vincent Granville shows an example on how to do this here[[1]](#1) and here[[2]](#2). Actually the exact example of the script is in the second reference. 

I won't go into detail with that script because he goes into very nice and useful detail. 

2. The "Global temperature" dataset from Kaggle. You can find the whole dataset and explanation here[[3]](#3). Inside the repo you can find the cleaned file that I used to create the music. 

3. The Notebook, this can also be turned into a script in no time but I left it like that to explain everything. It has all the steps I did to convert real data into music. 

You can also check Vincent Granville's books that are very useful, easy to read and also with concrete and generalizable examples.

If ths topics is of your interest you can also create new tones. Brian Foo also has a script regarding this[[4]](#4)
